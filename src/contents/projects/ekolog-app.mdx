# Tech for _Life on Land_

Climate change has increased the frequency of natural disasters, yet the flow of information remains slow. **Ekolog** is a mobile-first solution designed to bridge the gap between an incident occurring and the data being analyzed.

Built in alignment with **<abbr title="Sustainable Development Goal">SDG</abbr> 15 (Life on Land)**, the app empowers users to report environmental damage while using <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> to instantly classify the severity of the event.

## Subjective Reporting

When a user reports a flood or landslide, their description is often subjective. One person might call a small flood `Severe`, while another calls it `Minor`.

**The Goal** - We needed an objective way to categorize reports based on data (affected infrastructure, depth, area), not just feelings.

## AI-Powered Classification

We didn't just build a form, we built a smart analyzer.

### The Brain
I implemented a `K-Means Clustering` algorithm using `Python`. Unlike standard classification which needs labeled data, this unsupervised model analyzes historical disaster data to find natural groupings.

- It looks at factors like *infrastructure damage* and *casualty count*.

- It automatically clusters the report into `High Severity` or `Low Severity` buckets without human intervention.

### Native Android Architecture

On the frontend, We used `Kotlin` and `XML` to build a robust native Android experience. The priority was speed—users in disaster zones need an interface that loads instantly and works reliably.

### Serverless Backend

To handle real-time data without managing physical servers, We integrated `Firebase`.

* **Authentication** - Secure sign-up and login flows.

* **Database** - Storing reports and syncing them across devices.

## Key Features

- **Geo-Tagged Reporting** - Users can submit photos and location data, which helps authorities map the spread of damage.

- **Severity Auto-Tagging** - The moment a report is submitted, the system tags it as High/Low Risk based on the `K-Means model`.

- **Educational Hub** - The app includes a section for _Environmental Tips,_ educating users on how to prevent degradation before it happens.

## Challenges

The biggest technical hurdle was _bridging the gap_ between a Python-based Model and a Kotlin-based App.

- **Integration Strategy** - I learned how to decouple the Data Science model (which runs on Python) from the Mobile Client, using APIs to pass data back and forth.

- **Real-World Data** - Working with actual Indonesian disaster datasets taught me that real-world data is messy and requires significant preprocessing before it can be useful for AI.

Ekolog proved that mobile technology can be more than just social media, it can be a tool for environmental resilience. By automating the classification process, we created a proof-of-concept for faster, data-driven disaster response.
