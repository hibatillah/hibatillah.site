# The _Technopreneurship_ Journey

**MassBeat** was not just a design project, it was my entry into the world of **Technopreneurship**.

Born during the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic, I co-founded a team of three to tackle a growing problem: the disconnect between home workouts and professional guidance. While this project did not move to full-scale development, it served as a rigorous exercise in **Product Validation**, **UI/UX Design**, and **Business Planning**.

## Fitness in _Isolation_

When gyms closed during the pandemic, people lost access to equipment and, more importantly, professional guidance.

- **The Gap:** Users had to choose between expensive private trainers or generic, unguided YouTube videos.

- **The Insight:** Through our initial surveys, we found that users didn't just want a workout list, they wanted a *community* and *dietary accountability*.

## _Design Thinking_ Methodology

Unlike my engineering projects, MassBeat was driven strictly by the **Design Thinking** framework. We didn't write a single line of code until we understood the human element.

### 1. Empathize & Define

We conducted desk research and interviewed local gym trainers to understand their pain points in retaining clients remotely. We used **Affinity Mapping** to categorize hundreds of user insights into clear feature requirements.

### 2. Ideate & Prototype

I led the UI/UX phase using **Figma**. We adopted a mobile-first approach, knowing our users would be working out in their living rooms, not at desks.

    "Meal Plan" screen, and "Chat with Trainer" screen side-by-side.

## A _Holistic_ Ecosystem

We designed MassBeat to be more than a utility app. It was a platform connecting three pillars:

1.  **Workout Programs:** Tiered access (Basic vs. Premium) with video guidance.

2.  **Nutrition:** Integrated meal planning that adapts to the workout intensity.

3.  **Consultation:** A marketplace for trainers to offer shared or private digital sessions.

## Business Validation & Awards

Since the output of this project was the **Business Plan** and **High-Fidelity Mockups**, we validated our product-market fit through national business competitions.

Our ability to articulate the "Business Value" alongside the "User Experience" led to a series of podium finishes:

* **1st Runner Up** - GenBI Riau Business Plan Competition 2023

* **2nd Runner Up** - LIKMI #2 2023 by Yogyakarta State University

* **2nd Runner Up** - PIKMI 2023 by Bina Sarana Informatika University

* Participated in **1000 startup digital** program.

    If not, show a clean shot of your "Business Model Canvas" or "Design System".

This project taught me that a great product needs more than just clean code.

* We learned to validate assumptions using the **SEQ (Single Ease Question)** method during testing.

* We learned to adapt our features based on real feedback from competition judges and mentors.

* We gained a deep appreciation for how design decisions (like _Premium_ badges) directly impact the business revenue model.
