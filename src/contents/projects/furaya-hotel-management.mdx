# Upgrading Hotel Operations

The hotel industry relies on speed and service, but many hotels still use systems built decades ago. The **Furaya Hotel Project** was built to fix this.

I was recruited by a lecturer to join a team of four to build a real system for a client. Our goal was to replace their outdated desktop software with a modern, fast web application for the Front Desk.

## _Navigation_ Bottleneck

The hotel was running on a legacy desktop app from the early 2000s. It looked like an old computer BIOS screen—blocky and rigid, but the real problem was how it worked.

> The Back to Menu Trap

The system did not have a navigation bar. To switch from _Check-In_ to _Room Status,_ a staff member had to:

1.  Click a `Back` button to exit the current page.

2.  Wait for the Main Menu list to load.

3.  Click the new option.

This constant back-and-forth was too slow for a busy hotel lobby with guests waiting in line.

## Speed & Simplicity

The main goal was to remove that friction. I replaced the _Main Menu_ page with a **Persistent Sidebar**. Now, staff can jump from _Booking_ to _Guest List_ in one click, without ever losing their place.

We chose a tech stack that provided speed and stability:

- `Laravel` to handle complex booking rules securely.

- `React + Tailwind CSS` to make the interface responsive and modern.

- `Inertia.js` enables smooth, seamless navigation and data handling between Laravel and the frontend.

Using Inertia allowed us to build a fast, app-like experience (<abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr>) where pages load instantly, but kept the backend simple.

## Key Features

### 1. The Front Desk Dashboard
Designed the dashboard to give an instant overview. Instead of digging through menus, staff immediately see _Today's Check-ins, Occupancy Rates, and VIP Guests_ the moment they log in.

  {/* <ImageItem src={Furaya.roomGrid} alt="Room Status Grid" /> */}
{/* </ImageWrapper> */}

### 2. Visual Room Grid

In the old system, checking room status meant reading a text list. I changed this to a Data Table with Filtering and Sorting capabilities. Rooms are color-coded (Green for "Clean", Red for "Do Not Disturb"). This uses _Jacob's Law_ (using familiar patterns) to help staff process information instantly.

### 3. Role-Based Access (RBAC)

We set strict security rules to ensure data safety:

- **Staff:** Can Check-in/Check-out guests.

- **Admin:** Can manage Room Rates and Inventory.

- **Manager:** Can only view sales reports.

## Testing & Result

We tested the system to make sure it was ready for the real world.

- **Stress Test:** The system handled **100-200 users** at the same time without slowing down.

- **User Test:** The new navigation was a success. Staff reported that the **Sidebar workflow** was much faster and easier to learn than the old _Menu Index_ system.

The final system successfully modernized the hotel's workflow. By removing the clunky _BIOS-style_ navigation and replacing it with a modern web design, we helped the staff work faster and reduced the waiting time for guests.

This project was my **Final College Capstone**, and it was accepted because it solved a critical operational speed problem for the client.
