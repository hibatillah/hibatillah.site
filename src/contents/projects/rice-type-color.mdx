# The API Transition

While I had built full-stack applications using PHP before, this Rice Identification project was my first venture into **API-driven architecture**.

In my previous projects, the frontend and backend were tightly coupled (Monolithic <abbr title="Model-View-Controller">MVC</abbr>). This project required a different approach. I had to build a standalone web interface that could _talk_ to a separate Python backend. It was my first time implementing a true `API endpoint` to bridge the gap between a user's browser and a Deep Learning model.

## The _Research_ Problem

In the agricultural industry, manually sorting rice based on quality (often determined by color consistency) is labor-intensive and prone to error.

- **The Goal:** Automate the quality check process using Computer Vision to classify rice grains based on their color profile.

- **The Challenge:** We needed a way to make this complex Python processing accessible to a non-technical user through a simple web interface.

## _Data Mining_ Methodology

This project was part of our **Data Mining** curriculum, where we applied the standard pipeline:

### 1. Data Collection & Cleaning

We gathered a dataset of various rice types. Before feeding them into the model, we had to _clean_ the data, standardizing image sizes and removing noise, to ensure our color classification algorithm wouldn't be biased by lighting conditions.

### 2. Model Training

We used `Python` to build a model that could differentiate rice types based on RGB color histograms.

## Building the _Bridge_

The hardest part wasn't the UI, but the **Integration**.

At the time, I was comfortable with HTML and CSS, but connecting them to a running Python script was a mystery.

- **The Backend:** We used `Flask`, a micro-framework, to expose our Python model as an API endpoint.

- **The Frontend:** I built a Vanilla HTML/CSS interface and used `jQuery` to handle the communication.

## The _Mentorship_ Factor

I focused heavily on the frontend implementation, ensuring the user could upload an image and see the result without a page reload.

However, the _handshake_ between the frontend and the Flask backend was complex for my skill level at the time. Working closely with our laboratory assistant, I learned how to structure **AJAX requests** to send image data asynchronously.

> This collaboration demystified the concept of `API endpoints` for me, teaching me that a backend is simply a function waiting to be called by the frontend.

## Key _Takeaways_

This project was simple by industry standards, but it was a massive leap for my understanding of software architecture.

- **First Python Integration:** I moved from writing standalone scripts to building a web-accessible application.

- **Async Logic:** I learned why _Asynchronous_ operations (via `jQuery AJAX`) are crucial for heavy tasks like image processing, so the UI doesn't freeze while the server thinks.

- **Model-View-Controller:** Without realizing it then, I was implementing my first MVC pattern, separating the Data (Model), the Interface (View), and the Flask Logic (Controller).
