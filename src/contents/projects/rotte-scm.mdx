## The Award-Winning Capstone

This project was a milestone in my academic journey. In my second year, I led a team to build a comprehensive system that integrated three distinct subjects: **Framework Programming**, **Supply Chain Management (SCM)**, and **Data Visualization**.

Our efforts were recognized when this system won the **Best Capstone Project Group** award, standing out for its complex logic and practical application.

## Bakeries are Complex

Managing a bakery is more difficult than it looks. You don't just "sell bread." You have to manage the raw materials (flour, eggs, sugar) that go _into_ the bread.

- **The Disconnect** - If you sell 50 breads, you need to know exactly how much flour was used.

- **The Risk** - If you run out of flour, production stops.

- **The Solution** - We needed a system that automates this entire chain, from the Supplier to the Oven to the Customer.

## Key Logic

The heart of this system is the **Bill of Materials (BoM)** engine. I implemented logic that treats every product as a "recipe" of components.

When a customer orders **10 Chocolate Breads**, the system doesn't just deduct "10 Breads" from inventory. It triggers a **chain reaction**:

1.  It looks up the _BoM_ for Chocolate Bread.

2.  It calculates the required raw materials (e.g., 2kg Flour, 500g Cocoa).

3.  It automatically deducts those specific amounts from the Raw Material Inventory.

## Automated Procurement

We didn't just track stock, we automated the reordering process. I implemented a **Reorder Point (ROP)** system.

The moment a raw material (like Sugar) drops below a specific safety threshold, the system automatically triggers a **Pre-order Alert** for the Supplier. This ensures the bakery never faces a stockout during peak production.

## Building from Scratch

This project was built **entirely from scratch** using Tailwind CSS.

- **Why?** To truly master the fundamentals of CSS layouting and React state management without relying on pre-made UI kits.

- **The Result** - I built custom data tables, modal dialogs, giving me complete control over the design system.

This project was my first experience building a _Logic-Heavy_ application.

* **SCM Principles** - I learned that software isn't just about code, it's about mapping real-world business rules (like BoM and ROP) into database relationships.

* **MERN Mastery** - It solidified my understanding of the Fullstack `Javascript` ecosystem, specifically how to handle relational data (Products vs. Ingredients) in a NoSQL database like `MongoDB`.
