## Driving Digital Transformation via Agile at the Ministry of Finance

Stepping into Enterprise Modernization My internship at BPPK put me at the center of a massive digital transformation effort: replacing a legacy, nationwide room management system used by the entire Indonesian Ministry of Finance. The scope was intimidating—managing dorms, labs, and halls across numerous units for audiences ranging from general public users to high-level internal staff.

The challenge wasn't just technical; it was organizational. We needed to migrate complex, manual workflows into a modern digital experience within a very tight three-month development window.

## The Methodology

Embracing Agile Scrum Under Pressure To tackle over 100 required features with a lean team of three developers, we adopted a rigorous Agile Scrum methodology. This structure was crucial for maintaining velocity and managing scope creep.

- Structured Iterations: We worked in strict 2-week sprints. This timeboxing forced us to break down enormous requirements into manageable, shippable tasks.

- Constant Feedback Loops: Each sprint ended with a review session where we presented completed work to project managers. This immediate feedback loop allowed us to pivot quickly when a feature didn't align with the business need, saving weeks of wasted effort.

- Wearing Multiple Hats: In a small squad, there was no dedicated QA team. I learned to blend development with rigorous blackbox testing, ensuring that the complex workflows I built actually held up under real-world scenarios.

Stakeholder Collaboration & The Design Sprint One of the most valuable experiences was moving beyond code to understand the human element of the system. We didn't just receive a requirements document; we actively shaped it.

We conducted an intensive Design Sprint involving 20 - 30 Ministry employees as the actual future users of the system. Facilitating these face-to-face sessions was eye-opening. I moved from abstract assumptions to concrete user validation, witnessing first-hand the friction points in their existing daily operations. This direct interaction translated into a Business Requirement Document (BRD) and complex BPMN diagrams that truly reflected user needs rather than assumptions.

Growth & Key Takeaways This experience was a crash course in enterprise software delivery. It taught me that successful development isn't just about writing clean functions; it's about clear communication, disciplined planning, and empathy for the end-user.

I gained significant confidence in:

1. End-to-End Project Lifecycle: Seeing a massive project from vague initial interviews to a deployable preview.

2. Complex Workflow Management: Understanding how to build systems that cater to five distinct user roles with vastly different permissions and needs.

3. Team Synchronization: Working tightly with backend developers to ensure seamless data flow, learning to anticipate integration challenges before they occurred.
