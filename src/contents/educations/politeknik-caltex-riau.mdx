# A Journey of Rapid Acceleration

My time at Politeknik Caltex Riau was defined by a strict, fixed curriculum known as the Packet System. We couldn't pick and choose easy subjects, we had to master the full spectrum of the industry, from **Programming logic** and **Supply Chain Management** to **Enterprise Architecture**. This discipline transformed me from a complete beginner who questioned the utility of a `boolean` type into a _Cum Laude_ graduate capable of architecting complex systems.

## The _Massbeat_ Initiative
Born during the transition of the COVID-19 pandemic, **Massbeat** was my first step into the world of _Technopreneurship_. My team and I identified a critical need; a platform to bridge the gap between home workouts and professional trainer consultations.

- We developed a comprehensive business plan and High-Fidelity UI/UX Mockups to validate the user journey.

- The product's potential was recognized by the **1000 Startup Digital** program, where we were selected for incubation.

- We refined the product through the fires of competition, securing 1st Runner Up at <TextLink href={massbeat.related?.genbi} external>GenBI Riau</TextLink> and 2nd Runner Up at <TextLink href={massbeat.related?.likmi} external>LIKMI #2</TextLink> and <TextLink href={massbeat.related?.pikmi} external>PIKMI</TextLink>.

While we planned to build the full mobile app, we made the strategic decision to sunset the project to focus on our mandatory semester internships. This taught me a valuable lesson in resource allocation and project prioritization.

## _Best Capstone_ Award

In my second year, I led a team to win the **Best Capstone Project Group** award. This was a unique challenge that required integrating four distinct subjects into a single application:

- Framework Programming: Built a robust web app using React and Express.

- Supply Chain Systems: Implemented complex logic for inventory flow and logistics.

- Data Visualization: Created dashboards for business insights.

- Business Requirements: Drafted professional <abbr title="Business Requirement Document">BRD</abbr> to guide development.

## _Internship_ at Ministry of Finance

In my third semester, I achieved a major milestone by being selected for **MSIB Batch 6**, a highly competitive national internship program. I secured a position as a <TextLink href="/experience/frontend-intern-ministry-finance">Front End Developer</TextLink> at the Ministry of Finance at Jakarta, Indonesia.

This was my first exposure to a professional engineering environment. I worked directly with stakeholders to build a web-based room management system for ministry units. This experience bridged the gap between academic theory and real-world software delivery, teaching me how to manage strict software development standards and tight deadlines.

## _Final Thesis_ - Hotel Management System

For my final year, I was recruited by a lecturer to co-develop a production-grade system, which became my <TextLink href="/projects/furaya-hotel-management">Furaya Project</TextLink>. I was assigned the role of a Fullstack Developer that responsible for the Front Desk Module. My tech stack consisted of Laravel, React, and Inertia.js.

I managed the entire academic lifecycle of the software, from the Proposal Defense to structured Blackbox and Usability Testing, wrapping up with a successful Final Result Presentation.

## Skills & Competencies
Due to the comprehensive nature of the curriculum, I gained proficiency across the entire software lifecycle.

| Domain | Proficiency |
| :--- | :--- |
| Languages | Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, PHP, C#, Kotlin |
| Stack     | MERN, Next.js, Laravel, CodeIgniter, Flask, .NET |
| Business  | <abbr title="Customer Relationship Management">CRM</abbr>, <abbr title="Supply Chain Management">SCM</abbr>, Risk Management, <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> |
| Methods   | Agile, Design Thinking, UI/UX Design, Unit Testing, Blackbox Testing  |

I graduated in **October 2025** with 128 Activity Points (well above the 75 required), a testament to my strategy of learning through competitive excellence rather than passive participation.

Beyond the metrics and awards, these four years gifted me an invaluable network of brilliant peers and mentors. I left the campus not just with a degree, but with deep friendships and the technical resilience that will define the rest of my professional journey.
